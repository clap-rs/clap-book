# Contributing

We would love issues and pull requests to the Markdown files in the src directory. The chapters we
have planned but that we have not yet written appear greyed out in the sidebar of the rendered book.
We would love issues with ideas for what, specifically, you'd like to see covered in those planned
chapters!

Our [open pull requests][pulls] are new chapters or edits that we're currently
working on. We would love if you would read through those and make comments for
any suggestions or corrections!

If you're looking for ways to help that don't involve reading or writing, check
out the [open issues with the M-help-wanted label][help-wanted]. These might be
Rust code, frontend code, or shell scripts that would help us be more efficient
or enhance the book in some way!
