# Terms and Conventions

Before we get into the meat and potatoes of this book we need to lay out a few key terms and
acronyms.

* **CLI:** Stands for **C**ommand **L**ine **I**nterface and is the user facing portion of an
  application. This term is often incorrectly used interchangeably with "Command Line Utility"  or
  "Command Line Application." If this book uses the term CLI, it's referring *only* to the interface.

* **Command Line Application**: A program or application which runs in a terminal emulator, and
  typically does not have a Graphical User Interface (GUI). This term is often interchangeable with
  "Command Line Utility" or "Command Line Program"

Inline code will be marked `like this` and multiline block code will be marked

```
Like this
```

Key terms to remember will be marked in *italics* on their first use.

When running examples, the terminal will be displayed with a leading `$` if the command is meant to
be run as an unprivileged user (such as your normal user account), or a `#` if the command is meant
to be run as `root` or with administrative privileges. The leading character does not need to be
typed when copying commands.

Commands that are meant to be run on a Microsoft Windows terminal will be prefaced with a `C:\>`
prompt.

All commands should be able to run in either Linux, macOS, or Windows unless otherwise noted.
