# Terms and Conventions

Before we get into the meat and potatoes of this book we need to lay out a few key terms and
acronyms.

* **CLI:** Stands for **C**ommand **L**ine **I**nterface and is the user facing portion of an
  application. This term is often incorrectly used intechangably with "Command Line Utility"  or
  "Command Line Application." If this book uses the term CLI, it's refering *only* to the interface.
* **Command Line Application**: A program or application which runs in a terminal emulator, and
  typically does not have a Graphical User Interface (GUI). This term is often interchangable with
  "Command Line Utility" or "Command Line Program"
