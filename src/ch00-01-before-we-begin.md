# Before We Begin

Throughout this book there will be various example projects and code. While most of the code can be
[run online], it is strongly recommended to run it locally and experiment with various input/output.

In order to run the code locally you'll need the following installed:

 * A [Rust compiler] with `cargo` (the latest stable release)

The following items are only required to run nightly examples or to aid in running examples that
target a particular compiler version:

 * [`rustup`]

 All examples from this book can be found [on Github].
