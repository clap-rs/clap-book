Welcome to the book all about building powerful, intuitive, and fast command line applications using
the [Rust] programming language! This book aims to answer three distinct quesitons:

 * How should I structure and build a command line application?
 * How should I design the command line interface for my application?
 * How can I use [clap] to it's fullest potential?

 Each section will build on the lessons learned in previous sections, although this book does not
 strictly require being read linearly. The last section in particular is meant to be more of 
 reference than a front-to-back style read.
